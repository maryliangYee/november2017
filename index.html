    Milou Yee has been a collector of Arts for the past three decades since her work as an institutional stockbroker took her to London, Italy, and Tokyo. While working overseas, she has studied at SOAS, University of London in the field of Asian Arts. She has gained a deep appreciation and knowledge of historical objects while travelling extensively in Europe and Asia. Milou has developed a discerning eye for unique and significant artifacts. Her favorite pastime is attending Estate sales where she encounters objects of true value. She was offered a job at one of the top five auction houses in London. Milou indeed has a knack for investing.</p>
